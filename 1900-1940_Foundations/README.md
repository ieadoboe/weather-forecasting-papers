# Foundations of Weather and Climate Prediction

- **Richardson, L.F. (1911).** _"The approximate arithmetical solution by finite differences of physical problems involving differential equations, with an application to the stresses in a masonry dam."_ Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A, 210, 307-357.
  - Establishes finite difference methods that became the foundation for his numerical weather prediction work

- **Platzman, G.W. (1967).** _"A retrospective view of Richardson's book on weather prediction."_ Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 48, 514-550.
  - The definitive scholarly analysis of Richardson's 1922 work; explains what went wrong and why it mattered despite failure

- **Lynch, P. (1992).** "Richardson's barotropic forecast: A reappraisal." Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 73, 35-47.
  - Shows that with proper initialization (filtering), Richardson's method would have worked
