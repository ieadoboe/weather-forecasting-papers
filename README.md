# Weather Forecasting Papers: From Classical NWP to Modern NeuralGCMs

A curated bibliography tracing 120 years of weather prediction science

## Overview

This repository documents the evolution from Vilhelm Bjerknes' 1904 primitive equations through Richardson's numerical methods, Charney's filtered dynamics, ensemble data assimilation, machine learning breakthroughs (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather), and hybrid physics-ML models (NeuralGCM).

## Paper Evolution Categories

Each folder has its individual readme of papers it contains with a brief description of how it contributes to the weather prediction science research.
