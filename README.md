# Weather Forecasting Papers: From Classical NWP to Modern NeuralGCMs

A curated bibliography tracing 120 years of weather prediction science

## Overview

This repository documents the evolution from Vilhelm Bjerknes' 1904 primitive equations through Richardson's numerical methods, Charney's filtered dynamics, ensemble data assimilation, machine learning breakthroughs (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather), and hybrid physics-ML models (NeuralGCM).

## Paper Evolution Categories

Each folder has its individual readme of papers it contains with a brief description of how it contributes to the weather prediction science research.

- [Theoretical Foundations](1900-1940_Foundations) (1900-1940)
- [Filtered Equations & First Success Forecasts](1947-1960_First-Success-Forecasts) (1947-1960)
- [Instability & Predictability Limits](1956-1963_Instability-and-Predictability-Limits) (1956-1963)
- [Data Assimilation Methods](1960-2016_Data-Assimilation-Methods) (1960-2016)
- [Machine Learning Emergence](2019-2024_ML-Emergence) (2019-2024)
- [Hybrid Physics-ML Models](2024-2026_Hybrid-Models) (2024-)
- [Important Related Works](Important-Related-Works)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This bibliography aims to be comprehensive yet focused on seminal works that shaped weather prediction science.

### What to Contribute

- **Missing seminal papers** - Foundational works that influenced the field's trajectory
- **Key review papers** - Comprehensive surveys that synthesize major developments
- **Historical corrections** - Fixes to citations, dates, or descriptions
- **Context improvements** - Better explanations of papers' contributions
- **New categories** - Suggest additional thematic organization (e.g., "Parameterization Development", "Operational NWP History")

### What NOT to Contribute

- Every paper on weather forecasting (this is a _curated_ list, not exhaustive)
- Textbooks or books (journal articles only)
- Recent papers without demonstrated impact (wait for citations to accumulate)
- Tangentially related work (e.g., general climate modeling unless directly relevant to forecasting)

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Add your paper(s)** to the appropriate folder's `README.md` following the existing format:

   ```markdown
   ### Author(s), Year

   **"Paper Title"**  
   _Journal Name_, Volume, Pages.

   **Contribution:** [1-2 sentences explaining impact on weather forecasting science]

   **Key concepts:** [comma-separated keywords]
   ```

3. **Update the folder's README** if adding a new paper
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of what you're adding
   - Why the paper is significant
   - Which category it belongs to
   -

### Suggesting New Categories

If you believe a major theme is missing (e.g., "1974-1990 Parameterization Revolution" or "Ensemble Forecasting Methods"), open an **Issue** with:

- Proposed category name and date range
- 3-5 papers that would fit this category
- Justification for why it deserves separate organization

### Quality Standards

- Papers must be **peer-reviewed journal articles** (no arXiv-only unless historically significant)
- Descriptions must be **neutral and factual** (not promotional)
- Focus on **methodological/conceptual contributions** over incremental improvements
- Maintain **chronological and thematic coherence**
